A simple app built with React that fetches F1 race results from the Fast_F1 API.  
It dispays the results and also uses driver telemetry data to plot the race track and 
animate the drivers around the track.

I learned a lot in how to use react components and different techniques to normalize and resample the telemtry data.
doing so helped to maintain aspect ratio when resized, and to also provide a smoother animation(the original data 
had irregular time intervals between samples)
